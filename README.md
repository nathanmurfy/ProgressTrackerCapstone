Capstone Project

My inital idea for my project was to make something i could use in the future, so i decided to make a tracking app that
would allow you to track your workout for the day and to be able to save the files to keep record of any progress you make.

I am starting off with making my three classes named "Main", "TrainingExercises" and "TrainingTracker". The main
will be for calling methods, I will have TrainingExercises for my variables and getters and setters adn the
TrainingTracker will be where I make most of my methods and other objects.
